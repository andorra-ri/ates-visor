From there we will go up the façade on the right to the peak of the Torradella (2. 546 m). Again, we have two options: • We can follow the same climb route to the property (edge surrounded by an obvious wall). From here we will go down through the forest in the SO direction to the bridge of the River Valley (1. 870 m) and we''ll take the path of the sun to the edges of the Armia and to the car. • If snow conditions permit, we can make a direct descent to the Plains by the S slope of the Torradella. We''ll pass by the edge of the mud flats and follow the path of the mud flats of the Plains, which have left obvious stripes of forest.' WHERE route_code='VDR07';
