  avaluator:
    not_recommended: Not recommended
    not_recommended_indications: Mountain travel without expert or professional knowledge is discouraged. Despite careful choices, conditions are ripe for avalanche incidents, and persistent exposure heightens the risk of an avalanche encounter.
    extra_caution: Extra caution
    extra_caution_indications: Avalanches can be natural or human-caused. Understanding current avalanche risks is essential for safe travel. Regular slope assessments, safe habits, proper planning, group coordination, experience, and humility are crucial.
    caution: Caution
    caution_indications: Accidents are rare and conditions are suitable for avalanche terrain travel, but caution is needed. Recognizing hazards and maintaining safe travel and rescue skills are vital.
